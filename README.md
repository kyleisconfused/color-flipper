# color-flipper

A very generic beginner project. This bad boy is listed in pretty much every list of "Beginner JavaScript Projects" you can find, but hey--ya gotta start somewhere.

No tutorials used. 

The repo includes:

- An HTML file

- A CSS file

- A JavaScript file (featuring a massive colors array!)
